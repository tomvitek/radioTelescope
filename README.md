# RadioTelescope
Scanning the sky with radio antenna and equatorial mount. Work in progress!

Since it does not work yet, the master branch is empty (not considering LICENSE, .gitignore and this file). To see current development, checkout development branch.

## Build
In order to build this project, you need ROS installed on your RPi. Guide on that is here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Kinetic%20on%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi
After that, all you need is to call catkin_make in radioTelescope directory.
